# Sports Desktop App #

This is a desktop app built with Flask and Flask-Web GUI.

The aim of this app is to allow sports coahes to create their own training sessions and analyze the data over a 6 week period.

### Installation ###
You will need to install the following:
- Flask
- Flask SQL-Alchemy
- Flask Web GUI
- Datetime 
```
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pip install flaskwebgui
pip install datetime
```

This will be a simple implementtion of how a user would create a new project full of students, and then display the different projects created.

After that I will expand on the project by creating capablities for the user to upload data into the tables created, and implement different ways to view the information.
