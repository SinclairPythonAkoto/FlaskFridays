# Trust House #

This is the backbone of a simple app that allows users to rate a review of a property based on experience.  Users can choose to upload pictures to their review; the reviews made are confidential and is open for anybondy to make a review (could be a neihghbour, tenant, visitor/passing by).

There will be two pages - one to make a review, the other to view the reviews (and search through them).  For now it will be very basic, but with the intention to add & refactor code in the future.

I will also aim to make a public API so users can query the reviews from the information from the database.  The user will be returned a JSON object.
